'An old teacher was visited by many of his students, years after they left his class. They talk about how successful they have become in life and showered gratitude on their beloved teacher. Then they all start to talk of the pressure they are facing, the stress they go through to keep up with the expectations. Success is not making them happier. 

The teach gets up to prepare a large pot of coffee and comes back with a tray that contains a variety of cups. Some are made of Cristal, some are made of silver, and some are cheap plastic cups. He asks his students to pour the coffee, and they all reach for most beautiful and expensive cups available. When they sit back down the teacher acknowledges the most beautiful cups, but then point out that what they all really wanted was coffee. Regardless of the cup, the coffee was the same. 

"If social status, fashion, image position, social accepting are like the cup," he says, "then the life is like the coffee. Why do we try so hard to drink from a fancy cup, when all we want is good coffee. If you want to leave a stress-free life” he says, "ignore the cup and just enjoy the coffee."

million who won't survive the week.

the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture or the pangs of starvation,

arrest, torture, or death,
you are more blessed than almost three billion people in the world.

If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and are truly thankful, you are blessed because the majority can, but most do not.

If you can hold someone's hand, hug them or even touch them on the shoulder, you are blessed because you can offer God's healing touch.

If you can read this message,
you are more blessed than over
two billion people in the world
that cannot read anything at all.

You are so blessed in ways you may never even know."
